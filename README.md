# Library Sign In System

This repository documents the Django-based Library Sign In System I'm creating for OCU's library as my capstone project. The goal of this project is to replace the previous system I set up in an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was a great improvement over previous methods, but still left a bit to be desired. Namely, this project aims to add security and prevent accidental data deletion.
